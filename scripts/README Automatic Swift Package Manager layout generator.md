Swift Package Manager [has some strict requirements] (https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/Usage.md#creating-c-language-targets) to source files layout. We can gain SPM support with minimal project structure changes by applying an autogenerated layout based on symbolic links technics. SPM related files located under `spm` folder at project's root. You should **NEVER** modify it manually nor inlude to Xcode's project.
